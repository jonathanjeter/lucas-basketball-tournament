# QUICK REFERENCE: STEP-BY-STEP CLAUDE CODE PROMPTS

## üöÄ EXECUTE IN ORDER - Copy/Paste These Exact Prompts

### **STEP 1: Critical Systems Fix** ‚ö°
**Copy this prompt and send to Claude Code:**

```
claude-code --model sonnet-4 --allow-file-system --allow-directory-access --allow-npm

URGENT VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT: Cemetery project is Saturday September 6, 2025. Currently only 2-3 volunteers signed up, need 8-10+. Tournament was successful ($270 raised) but site still shows tournament registration instead of volunteer recruitment.

CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED TODAY:
1. Switch from staging to production mode (change VITE_STAGING_MODE=false in .env.local) to show correct $270 raised instead of $50
2. Fix volunteer registration form - it's likely broken like other forms were during tournament development
3. Add emergency "VOLUNTEERS NEEDED THIS SATURDAY!" banner to homepage with countdown to September 6
4. Verify volunteer form saves to database and sends email confirmations

Project details: Saturday Sept 6, 7:30 AM-12:00 PM, Pioneer Cemetery Waxahachie, manual labor with SAR training, minors OK with supervision.

Priority: Get volunteer signup system working immediately so we can recruit before Saturday.
```

## üéØ **BETWEEN STEPS:** Questions to Ask Lucas

### After Step 1:
- "Is the volunteer form now working? Can you test submitting a volunteer signup?"
- "Do you see the correct $270 fundraising total on the homepage?"

### After Step 2:  
- "What's your Venmo handle for donations?"
- "What email should people use for Zelle transfers?"
- "Does the homepage transformation look good for volunteer recruitment?"

### After Step 3:
- "Do you have the tournament photos ready to upload?"
- "Is the project page information accurate for Saturday's event?"
- "Should we add any specific SAR contact information?"

### After Step 4:
- "Have you tested the volunteer signup on your phone?"
- "Are you ready to deploy and start sharing for volunteer recruitment?"
- "Any final changes needed before going live?"

## üö® **EMERGENCY BACKUP PLANS**

### If Volunteer Form Still Breaks:
"The volunteer form isn't working. Create a simple contact form that captures Name, Email, Phone, and 'I want to volunteer Saturday' checkbox. We can manually follow up."

### If Homepage Changes Are Too Drastic:
"Keep existing structure but replace tournament registration with volunteer signup, add emergency banner, update stats to $270."

### If Timeline Too Tight:
"Focus ONLY on: 1) Fix volunteer form, 2) Add volunteer banner to homepage, 3) Switch to production mode. Skip tournament summary page for now."
