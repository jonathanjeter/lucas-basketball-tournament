- **Dual email templates** - participant confirmations and admin notifications  
- **Tournament-specific content** - August 30, 2025 at Finley Junior High School

### 3. **Seamless Registration Integration** (`/src/lib/supabase.ts`)

- **Dual notifications** - both participant and admin emails
- **Smart error handling** - registration succeeds even if email fails
- **Detailed email status reporting** - tracks success/failure for each email type

### 4. **User-Friendly Feedback** (`/src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx`)
- **Email status in success message** - "📧 Confirmation email sent!" or warning
- **Follow-up guidance** - reminds users to check spam folder if email fails
- **Extended display time** - gives users time to read email status
- **Clear visual indicators** - ✅ for success, ⚠️ for issues

### 5. **Configuration Dashboard** (`/src/components/DatabaseTest.tsx`)
- **Email configuration status** - shows which EmailJS components are configured
- **Visual indicators** - green checkmarks for configured, red X for missing
- **Setup guidance** - directs users to EMAIL_SETUP.md
- **Real-time status** - updates as configuration changes

### 6. **Environment Variables** (`.env.local`)
```bash
# EmailJS Configuration - Ready for your credentials
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-emailjs-service-id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-emailjs-public-key  
VITE_EMAILJS_PARTICIPANT_TEMPLATE_ID=your-participant-template-id
VITE_EMAILJS_ADMIN_TEMPLATE_ID=your-admin-template-id
```

## 🏀 Tournament-Specific Features:

### **Email Content Includes**:
- **Tournament Details**: Saturday, August 30, 2025, 8:00 AM - 4:00 PM
- **Location**: Finley Junior High School Gym with full address
- **Registration Info**: Team name, player count, age category, donation amount
- **Important Reminders**: Arrive 30 minutes early, bring water, wear basketball shoes
- **Eagle Scout Project**: Emphasizes supporting Lucas's Eagle Scout project
- **Professional Branding**: Orange/basketball theme matching your site

### **Admin Benefits**:
- **Instant Notifications** - Know immediately when teams register
- **Complete Details** - Full player roster and contact information in email
- **Dashboard Integration** - Direct links to manage registrations
- **Donation Tracking** - Highlighted donation amounts for fundraising tracking

## 🛠 How It Works:

### **Registration Flow**:
1. **User submits registration** → Database saves team and players
2. **Email system activates** → Builds participant and admin email data  
3. **Participant email sent** → Professional confirmation with tournament details
4. **Admin email sent** → New registration notification with all details
5. **User sees feedback** → Success message includes email status
6. **Admin gets notified** → Immediate email alert about new registration

### **Error Handling**:
- **Registration always succeeds** - Database operations complete first
- **Email failures don't block registration** - Participants can still register
- **Clear status feedback** - Users know if confirmation email sent
- **Graceful degradation** - System works fine without EmailJS configured

### **Email Status Tracking**:
```javascript
// Example return from registerTeam()
{
  data: teamData,
  error: null,
  emailStatus: {
    participantEmailSent: true,    // ✅ Confirmation sent
    adminEmailSent: true,          // ✅ Admin notified  
    emailErrors: []                // No issues
  }
}
```
